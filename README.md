## Overview

**Modes**:
- SLAM
- Localization only

**Inputs**
- Odometry
- Point cloud
- Images (optional)

PRISM-TopoMap takes input data using ROS1 (ROS2 version will release soon). In SLAM mode, it can build map from scratch or update a pre-built map, and save the updated map by a specified path. In localization only mode, PRISM-TopoMap loads a pre-built map from a specified path and localizes in it without any map change.

To run PRISM-TopoMap on your own robot or dataset, you need to install it as a ROS package, create a ROS launch file, and create a .yaml config file with all the input topic names and algorithm parameters (desribed below).

## Prerequisites:
- [OpenPlaceRecognition](https://github.com/alexmelekhin/openplacerecognition)
- [ROS](https://ros.org) Melodic or Noetic
- For simulated demo: [habitat-sim v0.1.7](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/tree/v0.1.7), [habitat-lab v0.1.7](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab/tree/v0.1.7), and [ROS tools for Habitat](https://github.com/CnnDepth/habitat_ros/tree/toposlam_experiments)

## Docker env

We provide a Dockerfile for building the environment with all the dependencies.

There are two versions:

- `prism-dev`: basic environment without ROS2
- `prism-dev-ros2`: environment with ROS2 support

To build the image run:

```bash
# without ros2
docker compose build prism-dev

# with ros2
docker compose build prism-dev-ros2
```

After you build the image, you can run it and attach interactive terminal:

```bash
# without ros2
docker compose run --rm -it prism-dev bash

# with ros2
docker compose run --rm -it prism-dev-ros2 bash
```


## Installation
After installing ROS and OpenPlaceRecognition, build PRISM-TopoMap as ROS package:
```
cd your_ros_workspace/src
git clone https://github.com/KirillMouraviev/toposlam_msgs
git clone https://github.com/KirillMouraviev/PRISM-TopoMap
cd ../..
catkin_make
```

After that, download the actual weights: [multimodal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4Nw0YqHC9PKiZXDmUAWZkOTvgporPnS/view?usp=sharing) or [point cloud only](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19uPohPxQUa71jQzApjGPVbSyJeVdggwF/view?usp=drive_link) for the place recognition model and set correct path to the weights in the config files `habitat_mp3d.yaml` and `scout_rosbag.yaml`.

## Demo
We provide two examples of usage: SLAM and localization in Habitat simulation and SLAM on rosbag from AgileX Scout Mini robot. The scenes for simulation demo are [here](data/mp3d_toposlam_validation_scenes). The rosbag from Scout robot can be downloaded [here](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/BT2iuAQKsmswmg).

Launch files for the demo contain the following args:
- `scene_name` (for simulated demo only): name of the scene from the dataset
- `path_to_save_graph`: absolute path to save the resulting topological map
- `path_to_load_graph` (for localization mode only): absolute path to the pre-built topological map
- `path_to_save_logs`: absolute path to dump all the debugging output files
- `config_file`: name of the config file (must be in `config` folder)

## Parameters in config

**Input**

  - `subscribe_to_images`: use image input or not (`true/false`).
  - `subscribe_to_gt_pose`: use ground truth input pose (for visualization, evaluation, building a high-precision map for subsequent localization, etc.) or not (`true/false`).

  `pointcloud`:
  - `topic`: the ROS topic for input point cloud.
  - `fields`: point cloud fields (may be `xyz` or `xyzrgb` for colored point clouds).
  - `rotation_matrix`: the matrix of point cloud rotation relative to the standard axes directions (x is forward, y is left, z is up).
  - `floor_height`: the floor level in the input point clouds (relative to the observation point). If the floor on the scene is uneven, the highest floor level should be set. May be set `auto` for dense point clouds.
  - `ceiling_height`: the ceiling level int the input point clouds (relative to the observation point). If the ceiling on the scene is uneven, the lowest ceiling level should be set. May be set `auto` for dense point clouds.
  - `subscribe_to_curbs`: use curbs data to refine scan matching or not (for outdoor usage, the curbs must be in PointCloud2 format).
  - `curb_detection_topic`: the ROS topic for curbs in point cloud format (if `subscribe_to_curbs` param is set to `true`).

  `odometry`:
  - `topic`: the ROS topic for input odometry.
  - `type`: ROS message type in the odometry topic (may be `PoseStamped` or `Odometry`).
